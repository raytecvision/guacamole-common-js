#guacamole-common-ts

Guacamole Common Typescript NPM module

This module is intended to be used in conjunction with guacamole-rd-ts front end and guacamole-lite-ts gateway. 

This is based off a previous work of raytecvision.
The work on this repo is highly experimental, and I have no prior experience on publishing packages to npm. Take this repo with a grain of salt.
